# calorieWatcher
A personal and private browser-based food diary to keep track of your daily calorie intake

Featuring (experimental HTML5 standard) "Add to Homescreen" for
Android (chrome firefox browsers I think), and the ability to
use offline, like a native app.

How to use:
the live version of this project is at:

Suggestions, tips/support, etc. welcome:

I highly recommend using my calorie calculator at:
https://stewved.github.io/calorieCalculator/
to determine how many calories you currently need, your body fat %, and how
much you need to gain or lose to reach your body fat % goal.

Once you know how many calories your need and your goal calorie intake, plug
them into the calorieWatcher, and start adding your foods.

If your food isn't in the list (quite likely as we all eat different stuff),
click the "Add New Food" button and give your food a name, it's amount of
calories per unit type. example:
name      | amount of calories | per number | per type
cucumber  | 15 calories        | 100        | g
cake!     | 243 calories       | 1          | 100g calories

Purpose of the app:

create a daily list of foods comsumed, where the calories are totaled
up so you can keep an eye on your daily calorie intake.

Use this in conjunction with https://stewved.github.io/calorieCalculator/
so that you know how many calories you need.

create and maintain a food database, consisting of foods and their
calories/100g or per unit.

You can add your own foods, and I hope to add the ability to submit
a food to be added to the main food database.

If this webapp becomes popular and I get a lot of requests to add macros,
vitamins, minerals, etc. I will consider it.

The webapp's list will be in meals which are made up of the individual
foods in the food database.

GOAL: better and easier than a spreadsheet while being private, because
other web-based food tracker apps sync to (the cloud) some server somewhere,
and I don't want any person or company knowing what I eat, how much, when I
eat it, etc.

I do not have a balanced diet. I do not have 5-a-day, but luckily the only
thing that matters for gaining or losing weight is the amount of calories
you eat in a day - whether from cucumber or cake, it doesn't matter!

The only difference to the body between cucumber and cake energy-wise is you
could eat a load more cucumber than cake.

Obviously this isn't the whole story because macros, vitamins, etc. are all
needed for the body and mind to work properly, but on an exreme example you
could lose weight eating only cake!

The caveat is that you wouldn't be eating very much cake and would be hungry
all the time because cake isn't filling.
